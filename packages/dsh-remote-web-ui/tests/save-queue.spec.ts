/**
 * Issue #1754: rapid saves of a settings field stopped taking effect after a
 * few rounds.
 *
 * A save is a Host round trip that also drives the profile reconcile, and
 * the Host runs settings writes inside one exclusive transaction. Two
 * overlapping saves therefore race each other: the Host refuses the loser
 * with "HMR transactions cannot be nested", and the card used to answer a
 * save pressed during a save by returning immediately, dropping the edit.
 *
 * The fix serializes: a save asked for during a save is queued and runs once
 * the first settles, so no two Host writes ever overlap.
